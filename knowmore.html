    <h4 id="React">1. React</h4>
     <p class="text-align">ReactJS, also known as React, is a well-known open-source JavaScript front-end library for creating dynamic and interactive applications and improving UI/UX design. Basically, it’s responsible only for the view layer. Facebook initially developed and maintained the technology, which was then used in some of its products, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. With frameworks such as Next.js, React can be utilized for developing single-page, mobile, or server-side applications. It allows code to be debugged more efficiently by separating it into components.</p>
     <p class="text-align">More than 220,000 websites currently utilize React. A few of the giants that use this platform for their applications/websites include Apple, PayPal, BBC, Dropbox, Reddit, and Netflix.</p>
       <h6>Key Features :</h6>
         <ul class="text-align">
           <li>The application built with ReactJS has a component-based architecture, meaning that it consists of several components, each with its own logic written in JS. The reusable nature of these components allows you to maintain the code when working on larger-scale projects.</li>
           <li>ReactJS is designed to support unidirectional data flow and one-way data binding. One-way data-binding gives you more control across your application.</li>
           <li>The Virtual DOM of React offers flexibility and speeds up app development. Document object models (DOMs) are APIs (Application programming interfaces) that manage how documents can be accessed and manipulated.</li>
           <li>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a markup syntax for describing the interface of an application.  With JSX, you can write and add HTML structures easily in React.</li>
           <li>With declarative UI, React code can be more easily read and fixed. In terms of developing UIs that are exciting and engaging, React JS is the best choice not just for web applications but also for mobile applications.</li>
         </ul>
    <h4 id="Bootstrap">2. Bootstrap</h4>
     <p class="text-align">Bootstrap is a free, open-source, and powerful front-end framework designed to create mobile-friendly, responsive websites and applications. Bootstrap includes CSS and JavaScript templates for typography, navigation, buttons, forms, and other important UI elements/components. This powerful toolkit contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools to create front-end design elements of responsive websites quickly and easily. With its pre-built components, users can add themes and icons to their designs.</p>
     <p class="text-align">The Bootstrap framework was initially developed by Twitter and has become the most popular front-end framework available today.  Bootstrap is very easy to use since developers only need basic HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge. A few of the giants that use this platform for their applications/websites include LinkedIn, Postman, Spotify, Twitter, Udemy, StackShare, Lyft, etc.</p>
       <h6>Key Features :</h6>
         <ul class="text-align">
           <li>Although Bootstrap is designed with responsive 12-column grids, components, and layouts, it is also very customizable. With a few tweaks, you can enable a fixed grid or a responsive one.</li>
           <li>Bootstrap also includes responsive utility classes. A responsive utility class can make a specific piece of content appear or hide only on specific devices, depending on the screen size. Web designers who want to create mobile or tablet-friendly versions of their websites will benefit greatly from this feature.</li>
           <li>In addition to LESS (Leaner Style Sheets) files, Bootstrap also includes old CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) files.</li>
           <li>By providing templates, Bootstrap enables inexperienced users to create a website easily through tutorials and demos.</li>
           <li>The Bootstrap framework contains a variety of components, such as navigation bars, progress bars, dropdowns, thumbnails, etc., that can easily be incorporated into your web page.</li>
         </ul>
    <h4 id="Flutter">3. Flutter</h4>
     <p class="text-align">Developed by Google, Flutter is an open-source, cross-platform UI framework that enables the development of flexible and native-like apps with the help of a singular codebase. This is one of the fastest-growing frontend frameworks for creating flexible and effective web designs. Its ability to create native capabilities and expressive elements on iOS and Android platforms is a major factor driving its popularity.</p>
     <p class="text-align">Flutter enables developers to create cross-platform apps quickly using the Dart programming language and the Skia graphical engine. Flutter – Dart makes it easy for developers to create apps fast. The Flutter framework is designed primarily for mobile applications running on both Android and iOS. A few of the giants that use this platform for their applications/websites include Google, Alibaba Group, Dream11, BMW, eBay, etc.</p>
        <h6>Key Features :</h6>
          <ul class="text-align">
            <li>Because Flutter is multiplatform, we can write the code once (single codebase), maintain it, and deploy it to multiple platforms and devices like mobile, web, desktop, and embedded devices.</li>
            <li>With Hot Reload, the developer can immediately see the results of their changes in the code. Changes are immediately reflected within the app. With Stateful Hot Reload, Flutter allows developers to build expressive UIs, full customizations, and native-like performance. </li>
            <li>Flutter applications are created with the Dart programming language, which utilizes JIT (Just-in-Time) compilation and AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation to improve startup times, functions, and performance.</li>
            <li>With this framework, you’ll be able to control your app’s codebase with automated testing, developer tools, and everything else you need to develop high-quality apps.</li>
            <li>Flutter provides widgets for developing customized specific designs. There are two sets of widgets in Flutter i.e., Cupertino and Material Design widgets that provide a glitch-free experience on any platform.</li>
          </ul>
    <h4 id="Angular">4. Angular</h4>
     <p class="text-align">AngularJS is an open-source Javascript front-end framework and is an integral part of the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, And Node.js). It is mostly used for developing single-page web applications (SPAs). Since it’s a flexible framework, developers can create progressive web apps or integrate the framework with technologies such as Ionic, Cordova, or NativeScripy to design near-native mobile applications.</p>
     <p class="text-align">The tool has inbuilt templates that make it easy for developers to build UI views quickly. AngularJS provides simple, fast data binding without developer intervention. By supporting caching, it reduces the CPU’s workload. It provides fast loading and less navigation, ensuring an effective user experience. Gmail, Forbes, Upwork,  Deutsche Bank, etc., are some of the popular websites and applications built using Angular.js.</p>
        <h6>Key Features :</h6>
          <ul class="text-align">
            <li>With an Angular application, data binding is performed without the need to write any separate code. By adding a few snippets of code, we are able to connect data from the HTML control to the application data.</li>
            <li>An Angular application is not browser-specific, so there are no browser-specific constraints. Besides internet explorer 8.0, it runs on all major browsers and on mobile devices, including Android and iOS-based devices.</li>
            <li>A built-in dependency injection feature in AngularJS makes it easy to develop, test, and understand applications.</li>
            <li>A number of built-in services are available with AngularJS, such as $http to make XMLHttpRequests. They are singleton objects that are instantiated only once in the app.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, Angular’s templates make it possible to create a user interface views rapidly, which aids software development teams to become more productive.</li>
          </ul>
    <h4 id="Vuejs">5. VueJs</h4>
     <p class="text-align">The popular Javascript framework ‘Vue.js’ was created by Evan You and used to develop interactive UIs (User Interfaces) (UIs) and SPAs (Single-page applications). Vue.js is one of the best JavaScript frameworks for creating a lightweight and adaptable interactive UI elements. The MVVM model (Model View-View Model) architecture pattern and its lightweight nature make Vue.js extremely easy to implement.</p>
     <p class="text-align">HTML and CSS knowledge is required to use Vue.js. Also, Vue.js has a core library focused solely on the view layer. Frameworks like this can be seamlessly integrated into big projects for front-end development without causing any problems or issues. 9GAG, GitLab, Nintendo, Behance, and Laravel are some of the popular websites and applications built using Vue.js.</p>
        <h6>Key Features :</h6>
          <ul class="text-align">
            <li>VueJS provides computed properties, which enable you to detect changes made to UI elements and perform calculations accordingly. You do not have to add any additional code to do this.</li>
            <li>VueJS comes with several built-in directives for performing various tasks on the frontend, such as v-show, v-if, v-else, v-bind, v-model, and v-on.</li>
            <li>Watchers in Vue.js allow you to watch or monitor a component and perform specified actions when its values change. This is a more general way to watch and respond to data changes in a Vue instance. It is particularly useful when performing asynchronous operations.</li>
            <li>VueJS components allow you to create custom elements that you can reuse in HTML.</li>
            <li>Various transitions can be applied to HTML elements when they are added/updated/removed from the DOM (Document Object Model).</li>
          </ul>
    <h4 id="jQuery">6. jQuery</h4>
     <p class="text-align">jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. As of Aug 2022, jQuery is used by 77% of the 10 million most popular websites. Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, having at least 3 to 4 times more usage than any other JavaScript library.</p>
     <p class="text-align">jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.</p>
